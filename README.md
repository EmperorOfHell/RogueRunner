## Summary
Rogue Runner is a game in the style of an endless runner. This game was done as a university project. 

## How to play the game
The game starts with the main splash screen where the user needs to press "Enter" to start playing. This screen also shows the game logo.

After the user presses the button, the game starts. The user can press "Space" to jump over obstacles in the form of monsters. 

When you touch the monsters, your health decreases by one. When the health is zero, the game is over.

The game has a scoring system: 1 point will be awarded for each successfully passed monster, but if the player touches the monster, the point is not counted.
